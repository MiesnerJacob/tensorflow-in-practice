# tensorflow-in-practice
These are assignments from the TensorFlow in practice classes taught by Laurence Moroney and Andrew Ng.

There were 4 courses that covered how to build models in TensorFlow:

1. Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
2. Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow
3. Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow
4. Sequences, Time Series and Prediction

The models built in these courses help you understand the mechanics of DNNs, CNNs, RNNs, and Time Series/Sequence models.
